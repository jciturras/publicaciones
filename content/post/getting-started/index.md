## About the diagram:

The diagram above shows the distribution of papers according to 6 thematic categories: Sociability, Conflict, Territorial factors, Socioeconomic factors, Political system and Others. We consider in the diagram all those papers reported during 2021 that have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

Important: These categories do not respond to the Centre's lines of research, but are another complementary way of organizing the Centre's productivity.
