abstract = "This manuscript presents the results of a pilot study, Kuykuitin. A project that provides history teachers of elite schools in Chile with firsthand contact with history teachers in an intercultural school in the Araucanía. This region is the conflict zone with higher levels of violence between the Mapuche and the Chilean State. The pilot study analyzes the perceptions of the students of elite schools in the city's capital -- Santiago -- about the Mapuche and the present-day conflict, before and after their history teachers participated in the Kuykuitin project."
