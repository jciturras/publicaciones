abstract = "In this conversation, Claire Alexander discusses the overlap between her social research and biographical trajectories, showing us how shifts in academic work are linked to broader transformations, in this case, linked to the politics of identity, ethnicity, and race in the United Kingdom. Alexander also tells us about the meaning and value of ethnographic work, including her experience of “revisiting” places and maintaining links with her research participants over time. Strongly influenced by Stuart Hall, Claire also talks about the importance of communicating ideas to and generating dialogues with those outside of academia. She reflects on her interdisciplinary academic collaborations and work with civil society organizations, and invites us to be committed to and engaged with our contexts and social transformation."
