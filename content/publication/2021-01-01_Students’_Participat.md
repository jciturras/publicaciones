abstract = "Student participation has been associated with positive student outcomes, such as civic development, an active public life, and prosocial behaviors. However, the impact of student participation in other areas of student development remains unexplored. Here, we hypothesized that students’ participation in the functioning of schools might also improve academic performance, prevent antisocial behaviors, and improve the subjective well-being of adolescents. We used structural equation modeling to test these ideas with data from a cross-sectional questionnaire study (N =,791) in Santiago, Chile. Student participation –which we further separated into the perception of being listened to by school authorities and having some power to define norms of co-existence in school– was predictive of higher academic achievement and lower levels of antisocial behavior, which in turn predicted higher student life satisfaction. These results are particularly relevant to the design and evaluation of interventions and education policies, providing a compelling argument for the necessity of promoting student engagement and real participation in the school community."
