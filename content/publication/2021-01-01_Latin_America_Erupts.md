abstract = "Chile faces its most crucial re-foundational moment since the recovery of democracy in 1990. A constitutional convention composed of a majority of nonpartisan members and dominated by no single group will write a new constitution to replace the one enacted in 1980 by Augusto Pinochet. Will this process bring social norms in tune with formal institutions, or will the result be a polarized politics and deeper crisis? This political moment presents great challenges, but it is also an opportunity to resolve a longstanding political conflict and build a more democratic and stable future for the country."
