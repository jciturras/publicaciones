abstract = "In this article, we argue that efforts to internationalize higher education that do not make visible the colonial legacy in the higher education space become catalysts that intensify and reproduce the power asymmetries among countries, universities, and ways of knowing. To support and illustrate our argument, we carried out an analysis of two of the largest international scholarship programs implemented by Latin American countries, namely, the Brazilian 'Science without Borders' and the Chilean 'Becas Chile' programs. Our analysis shows that Brazil and Chile, aiming to enhance their position in the so-called 'knowledge economy', implemented strategies of internationalization that assumed, naturalized, and possibly biased the intrinsic benefits of internationalization at the expense of local needs and realities. We also found that Brazil and Chile embrace a concept of internationalization equated with academic mobility to (almost exclusively) Western/European industrialized countries of the global North. https://blog.ufes.br/kyriafinardi/publicacoes/"
