abstract = "We examined the idea that endorsement of state-level restrictive language policies can be understood as an ingroup-preserving behaviour driven by majority group members? experiences of linguistic-based collective angst (i.e., concern about the future vitality of the ingroup?s language). We did so in the context of legislative reform aimed to enforce monolinguistic public education in Ukraine ? a linguistically heterogeneous nation-state with a history of a foreign ethno-political domination. Specifically, we hypothesized that collective angst is most likely to be experienced when majority group members feel higher attachment to Ukraine (vs. glorification) and shared beliefs about historical linguicide of the Ukrainian language. Using data from a public opinion survey (N = 774), we found support for the mediation model ? higher attachment and beliefs about historical linguicide predicted increased support for restrictive policies directly and through collective angst, whereas glorification was found to be a non-significant predictor in this relation. Our results highlight the role of the specific content of protagonists? social identities in predicting their support for cultural assimilation of ethnic minority groups within heterogeneous societies."
