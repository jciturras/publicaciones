abstract = "In this study, we examine whether the spatial structure produces differences in access to social capital and the status homogeneity of networks in Santiago, the capital of Chileâ€”a highly segregated city. We hypothesize that residents of different areas, especially those living in spatial contexts of poverty and wealth, differ considerably in terms of the social resources to which they have access. We combine survey data with georeferenced data from 700 residents in 181 census tracts. The spatial structure is measured as a combination of spatial conditions, such as land values, density, and urban violence. Our results show that the spatial structure determines network resources, even after considering social class. Specifically, living in privileged areas is associated with highly resourceful networks, whereas living in marginalized areas goes together with network poverty and low-status contacts. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial segregation reinforces differential social resources among classes."
