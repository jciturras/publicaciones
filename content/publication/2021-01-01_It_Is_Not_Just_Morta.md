abstract = "Abstract                            Objective               Provide a synthesis of the COVID-19 policies targeting older people in Chile, stressing their short- and long-term challenges.                                         Method               Critical analysis of the current legal and policy measures, based on national-level data and international experiences.                                         Results               Although several policies have been enacted to protect older people from COVID-19, these measures could have important unintended negative consequences in this group’s mental and physical health, as well as financial aspects.                                         Discussion               A wider perspective is needed to include a broader definition of health—considering financial scarcity, access to health services, mental health issues, and long-term care—in the policy responses to COVID-19 targeted to older people in Chile."
