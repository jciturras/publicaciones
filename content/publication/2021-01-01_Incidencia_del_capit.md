abstract = "The paper shows that in Uruguay and Chile, individual social capital has significant effects on occupational achievement, once the effects of demographic, educational and labor factors have been discounted. In both countries, occupational achievement is partly due to social contacts, although in Chile, social capital tends to increase inequality. Moreover, women’s access to formal occupations is associated with achieving higher status, yet exercising positions of authority has a stronger effect on status for men. Data are drawn from the emote survey in Uruguay and the enes survey in Chile."
