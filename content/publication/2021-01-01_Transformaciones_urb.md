abstract = "The fear of crime reconfigures urban living in neighborhoods. This is because it does not refer to the direct experience of crime, but to a multiplicity of factors that develop on the scale of the street, the neighborhood and the city. Literature has shown that behind the fear of crime are hidden various fears and concerns experienced by the subjects. An aspect less explored by urban studies and criminology refers to how this feeling, which is subjectively determined in daily life, is interwoven in processes and transformations of the city scale. From a qualitative study carried out in the commune of Maipú in Santiago, Chile, this article explores the judgments and evaluations that the subjects perceive and mean the danger and the crime and how these are related to the urban changes in their neighboring environments. The results show that, in a territory affected by urban transformations, the figure of the “empeligrosamiento” towards the unknown emerges, constitutes a form of relation that signifies social interactions at the same time as it sharpens the loss of subjective control over the neighborhood space in which it is inhabited."
