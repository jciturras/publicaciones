  abstract = {What happens to the anti-establishment sentiments of pro-incumbent voters for a populist force that is in government and thus controls the political system? This article examines this question utilizing the case of Turkey, a country in which a populist force has been in power for more than a decade. By analyzing populist attitudes among a nationally representative sample, we demonstrate that while the voters of the incumbent populist party (AKP) are less likely, compared to everyone else, to hold populist sentiments, the same voters are also substantially more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that center on malign foreign powers. This finding is relevant beyond Turkey, because it demonstrates that populist forces might be able to maintain popular support and thus stay in power for a long stretch of time by employing government propaganda to fuel an antagonism against conspiratorial foreign and global forces.},

  abstract = {Studies of the current Chilean population performed using classical genetic markers have established that the Chilean population originated primarily from the admixture of European people, particularly Spaniards, and Amerindians. A socioeconomic-ethno-genetic cline was established soon after the conquest. Spaniards born in Spain or Chile occupied the highest Socioeconomic Strata, while Amerindians belonged to the lowest. The intermediate strata consisted of people with different degrees of ethnic admixture; the larger the European admixture, the higher the Socioeconomic Level. The present study of molecular genomic markers sought to calculate the percentage of Amerindian admixture and revealed a finer distribution of this cline, as well as differences between two Amerindian groups: Aymara and Mapuche. The use of two socioeconomic classifications – Class and Socioeconomic Level – reveals important differences. Furthermore, Self-reported Ethnicity (self-assignment to an ethnic group) and Self-reported Ancestry (self-recognition of Amerindian ancestors) show variations and differing relationships between socioeconomic classifications and genomic Amerindian Admixture. These data constitute a valuable input for the formulation of public healthcare policy and show that the notions of Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Strata and Class should always be a consideration in policy development.},

  abstract = {In a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19, different national states around the world have introduced strict measures to regulate social interaction that have affected the interdependence of modern societies. In this article, we argue that this handling of the pandemic produces a conflict of solidarities that can be interpreted by expanding Durkheim’s classic formulations (organic and mechanical solidarity) to include the distinction between fragmentary solidarity (based on distancing) and ordinary solidarity (based on empathy and equal treatment). The conflict is triggered precisely by the introduction of fragmentary solidarity. Through this conceptualization, we identify different paradoxes and problems that the pandemic poses for present-day society and analyze how it attempts to overcome them through a generalization of ordinary solidarity. The paper concludes that the conflict of solidarities that characterizes the pandemic is not a passing phenomenon. Its anchorage in the complexity and interdependence of contemporary technological, social, and natural conditions points to its persistence.},

We develop a model in which office and policy-motivated politicians vote in favor of or against regulations on these issues. We derive conditions under which politicians flip-flop, voting according to their policy preferences at the beginning of their terms but in line with the preferences of single-issue minorities as they approach reelection. To assess the evidence, we study U.S. senators' votes on gun control, the environment, and reproductive rights. In line with the model's predictions, we find that election proximity has a pro-gun effect on Democratic senators and a pro-environment effect on Republican senators; these effects arise for senators who are not retiring, do not hold safe seats, and represent states where the single-issue minority is of intermediate size. Also in line with our theory, election proximity does not affect votes on reproductive rights due to the presence of single-issue minorities on both sides.},

We see the investors' predominant profile, comprising gender, social status, age, and investment preferences (price, size, and location of the unit bought). The profile obtained remind of the Chilean elite and upper-middle strata and shows a bias to male investors. For the analysis, we separate individual and firm investors, also small and large-scale (prime) investors (5 or more properties). The analysis covers the Santiago Metropolitan Area, focusing on three inner districts with the highest investment rate. Results converge with theoretical discussions about the expanding 'rentierism' in different global settings, namely ownership concentration and home prices increase, as the most significant effects.},

We explored the factor structure of coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and their associations with trust in science in predicting risk perceptions using survey data collected in Ukraine ( N = 390), Turkey ( N = 290), and Germany ( N = 408). We further expected conspiracy beliefs and distrust of science to predict people’s willingness to attend public gatherings versus maintaining preventive physical distancing through optimistically biased risk perceptions. Metric noninvariance for key constructs across the samples was observed so the samples were analysed separately. In Ukraine, a two-factor structure of conspiracy beliefs was found wherein COVID-19 bioweapon (but not COVID-19 profit) beliefs were negatively associated with public gathering through optimistically biased individual risk perceptions. In Turkey and Germany, conspiracy beliefs showed a single-factor solution that was negatively associated with preventive distancing and positively related to public gathering through optimistically biased public risk metaperceptions. The hypothesis about the direct and indirect effects of trust in science on risky health behaviour was partially confirmed in all three samples. The observed discrepancies in our findings are discussed.},

We did so in the context of legislative reform aimed to enforce monolinguistic public education in Ukraine ? a linguistically heterogeneous nation-state with a history of a foreign ethno-political domination. Specifically, we hypothesized that collective angst is most likely to be experienced when majority group members feel higher attachment to Ukraine (vs. glorification) and shared beliefs about historical linguicide of the Ukrainian language. Using data from a public opinion survey (N = 774), we found support for the mediation model ? higher attachment and beliefs about historical linguicide predicted increased support for restrictive policies directly and through collective angst, whereas glorification was found to be a non-significant predictor in this relation. Our results highlight the role of the specific content of protagonists? social identities in predicting their support for cultural assimilation of ethnic minority groups within heterogeneous societies.},

  abstract = {Despite the ongoing shift in societal norms and gender-discriminatory practices toward more equality, many heterosexual women worldwide, including in many Western societies, choose to replace their birth surname with the family name of their spouse upon marriage. Previous research has demonstrated that the adherence to sexist ideologies (i.e., a system of discriminatory gender-based beliefs) among women is associated with their greater endorsement of practices and policies that maintain gender inequality. By integrating the ideas from the system justification theory and the ambivalent sexism theory, we proposed that the more women adhere to hostile and benevolent sexist beliefs, the more likely they would be to justify existing gender relations in society, which in turn, would positively predict their support for traditional, husband-centered marital surname change. We further argued that hostile (as compared to benevolent) sexism could act as a particularly strong direct predictor of the support for marital surname change among women. We tested these possibilities across three cross-sectional studies conducted among women in Turkey (Study 1,               N               =118, self-identified feminist women; Study 2,               N               =131, female students) and the United States (Study 3,               N               =140, female students). Results of Studies 1 and 3 revealed that higher adherence to hostile (but not benevolent) sexism was associated with higher support for marital surname change indirectly through higher gender-based system justification. In Study 2, the hypothesized full mediation was not observed. Consistent with our predictions, in all three studies, hostile (but not benevolent) sexism was found to be a direct positive predictor of the support for marital surname change among women. We discuss the role of dominant ideologies surrounding marriage and inegalitarian naming conventions in different cultures as obstacles to women’s birth surname retention upon marriage.},

It was only in 2006 that a law created the National Commission for Accreditation and two instruments: programmes and institutions accreditation. This article analyses the design and implementation of the latter policy instrument using mixed methods, including in-depth interviews with key actors. Our findings show that, although regulations have introduced quality assurance as a key element in higher education policy, the link established between accreditation and financing has generated incentives that dangerously weaken these quality mechanisms.},

Todas ellas se promulgaron con el fin de promover transformaciones importantes en sus países y sociedades. Mucho más recientemente en Chile se canalizó gran parte de la enorme, diversa e intensa movilización social de fines del 2019 hacia un plebiscito en el cual porcentajes cercanos al 80\% de los votantes decidieron que se requiere una nueva constitución que reemplace a la dictatorial de 1980 y que esta debe ser. elaborada por una Convención Constituyente completamente electa a tal fin. En las constituciones políticas convergen las esperanzas de transformación. Y complementariamente, en el caso de Chile, se considera que el “cerrojo constitucional” es justamente lo que impide el cambio.},

Linked to these perceptions, we explore our interviewees’ attitudes towards other immigrant groups. We contend that, while immigrant participation in policymaking often is a normatively desired form of inclusion, immigrant perceptions of other immigrants and of immigration policy are not uniform. We find that immigrants can have very negative perceptions of other immigrants, favouring restrictive policies. Immigrants influence the contexts of reception for newcomers, and—in the case of Chile—they have voting and political rights that places them in a position of casting some influence over immigration policies. Studying the Venezuelan case is particularly illuminating, as this immigration was considered a desirable or acceptable immigration.},

The first section describes the theoretical concepts that sustain the proposal, in particular, the concept of border as a mediating artifact, the theoretical concept of the bordering process as a social practice, and finally, identity narratives and the dialogical perspective of the self. The second section analyzes the proposals and limitations of some studies on identity narratives in international borderlands. In the same section, we develop our theoretical proposal for studying border identity narratives, which attempts to overcome some limitations of previous studies and respond to the debate on the role of others in the construction of the self. We conclude that the inclusion of the border as a semiotic artifact and the bordering process in the construction of the self provide a new perspective of identity narratives as border narratives for the study of border experiences throughout human development.},

Although OPE is mostly explained by the same determinants that account for IPE, the center-periphery divide influences OPE and IPE in opposite directions. Those who reside in the territorial—and political—periphery believe more strongly that they can use Internet to participate in public affairs (OPE), though they do not feel more competent in doing so (IPE).

Currently, 15 RCPs meet worldwide in every region, except the Caribbean, to form non-binding agreements and to coordinate migration policy approaches. Building on previous reports, migration governance literature, and existent thematic analyses specific to the region, we evaluate RCPs’ multilevel migration policy coordination by comparing national laws to regional topics and accords. We compare two decades of national legislation in all 12 South American countries to regional discussion at the South American Conference on Migration (SACM) since its first annual meeting in 2000. We find synergies and discrepancies between translating regional migration governance strategies from the RCP into national-level migration management. The SACM has reinforced the member states’ focus on regional integration and provided a space for dialogue to agree on approaches and best practices. Yet, countries have not uniformly incorporated these into national legislation. Our multilevel analysis reveals the complexities that RCPs face in overcoming regional-national discrepancies in immigration policy coordination.},

Counterfactual policy experiments suggest that, for teenagers with disadvantaged backgrounds, interventions that combine mild improvement in their schooling opportunities with free tuition (by adding 22 USD per enrollee-year to the existing voucher) would lead to an 11\% decrease in the fraction of those ever arrested by age 18 and a 17\% increase in the fraction of those consistently enrolled throughout primary and secondary education.}

  abstract = {What does it mean to be happy? The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or “WEIRD” measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or “independent”), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emic-etic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver \& Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky \& Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto \& Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country’s “WEIRD-ness.” Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is “WEIRD-er” than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations.},

We propose that differences exist between hierarchical forms of diversity, which might erode social trust, and cultural differences that might foster new social links in heterogeneous communities. In Chile, strong material inequalities represent the main form of hierarchical differentiation, while south-to-south immigrants convey qualitative differences based on race, ethnic origin, or cultural practices. In contrast to most Western industrialized countries, where material and ethnic differences tend to converge, they appear to be uncoupled in Chile, explaining the presence of immigrants at different levels of the social hierarchy. We analyze original data from a Latin American country with high domestic inequality. Multilevel models nested at the city level reveal that social capital is negatively correlated with socioeconomic diversity, but positively correlated with immigrant diversity, suggesting that uncoupling these differences has a positive effect on social capital development.}

Building on previous work on multidimensional poverty and employment indicators, the paper uses the Alkire/Foster (AF) method to construct a synthetic indicator of the QoE               at an individual level.               It selects four dimensions that must be considered as essential to QoE deprivation: income, job stability, job security and employment conditions. These dimensions then subdivide into several indicators, a threshold for each indicator and dimension is established before defining an overall cut-off line that allows for the calculation of composite levels of deprivation.  The results generated by this indicator show that Central American countries can be divided into three distinct and robust performance groups in terms of their QoE deprivation. Overall, approximately 60\% of the deprivation levels are attributable to non-income variables, such as occupational status and job tenure. The methodology used can allow policymakers to identify and focus on the most vulnerable workers in a labour market and highlights the fact that having a formal written contract is no guarantee of good job quality, particularly in the case of women.},

  abstract = {Whether there are common features inherent to the psychology of Indigenous peoples around the globe has been the subject of much debate. We argue that Indigenous peoples share the experience of colonization and its social and psychological consequences. We develop this argument across four sections: ( a) the global history of colonization and social inequalities; ( b) aspects concerning identity and group processes, including the intergenerational transmission of shared values, the connection with nature, and the promotion of social change; ( c) prejudice and discrimination toward Indigenous peoples and the role of psychological processes to improve relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples; and ( d) the impact of historical trauma and colonialism on dimensions including cognition, mental health, and the well-being of Indigenous peoples as well as the basis for successful interventions that integrate Indigenous knowledge. Finally, we address future challenges for research on these topics.             Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 73 is January 2022.

Two unique data sets were used: dyads of activist parents and their adult children (Study 1, N = 100 dyads) and student activists who participated in a yearlong, three-wave longitudinal study (Study 2, Ns wave 1 = 1,221, Wave 2 = 960, and Wave 3 = 917). Parents’ past and current participation directly and indirectly predicted children’s protest participation in Study 1, while Study 2 showed a similar pattern longitudinally: Perceptions of parents’ participation (descriptive family norm) and approval (injunctive family norm) predicted change in collective action participation over time. Together, results highlight family environment as a critical setting for the intergenerational transmission of protest.},

  abstract = {Immediate contextual information and world knowledge allow comprehenders to anticipate incoming language in real time. The cognitive mechanisms that underlie such behavior are, however, still only partially understood. We examined the novel idea that gender attitudes may influence how people make predictions during sentence processing. To this end, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment where participants listened to passive-voice sentences expressing gender-stereotypical actions (e.g., “The wood is being painted by the florist”) while observing displays containing both female and male characters representing gender-stereotypical professions (e.g., florists, soldiers). In addition, we assessed participants’ explicit gender-related attitudes to explore whether they might predict potential effects of gender-stereotypical information on anticipatory eye movements. The observed gaze pattern reflected that participants used gendered information to predict who was agent of the action. These effects were larger for female- vs. male-stereotypical contextual information but were not related to participants’ gender-related attitudes. Our results showed that predictive language processing can be moderated by gender stereotypes, and that anticipation is stronger for female (vs. male) depicted characters. Further research should test the direct relation between gender-stereotypical sentence processing and implicit gender attitudes. These findings contribute to both social psychology and psycholinguistics research, as they extend our understanding of stereotype processing in multimodal contexts and regarding the role of attitudes (on top of world knowledge) in language prediction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reconstruct types of simultaneous stress trajectories in the family and employment domain at different stages of life and estimate their association with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in old age. METHODS: We used a retrospective, face-to-face, representative survey of people aged 65 to 75 years in the city of Santiago, Chile, (n = 802). We performed a multichannel sequence analysis to reconstruct family and employment stress trajectory types at various life stages and then used logistic regression models to estimate the association of these trajectory types with CVA in old age, controlled for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Four representative types of family and employment stress trajectories were identified: (1) Absence of family and employment stress, (2) Absence of family stress, persistent employment stress, (3) Absence of family stress, out of the labor market, and (4) Persistent family stress, absence of employment stress. The 61.7\% of the sample followed trajectories marked by the permanent presence of family and/or employment stress. Likewise, 18.3\% had a trajectory characterized by prolonged absence from the labor market. Individuals with persistent family or employment stress trajectories, as well as those with extended periods of inactivity, are more at risk of developing CVA. CONCLUSIONS: Stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease experienced by many people at different stages and domains of life on a prolonged basis. Consequently, prevention systems for this type of chronic diseases should emphasize the highly harmful effects of daily and cumulatively stressful life experiences. This could mitigate the multiple health and financial consequences associated with CVA.},

In this work, we shed light on this issue by considering the effect of the level of empathy and the social class of the recipient of help on two types of prosociality, namely helping and caring. In one experimental study, we found that for high-class participants, empathy had a positive effect on helping, regardless of the recipient’s social class. However, empathy had no effect for low-class participants. When it comes to caring, empathy had a positive effect for both high and low-class participants, but only when the recipient of help belonged to the same social class. This highlights that empathy by itself is not sufficient to promote cooperative relations and that the social class of the recipient of help should be taken into account to shed light on this issue.},

To illustrate the functioning of a circuit of this type, we take the example of the Project Syndicate platform.},

Conceived in this way, there is no straightforward relationship between populism and the welfare state. In this contribution we explore this relationship in detail. In the first part of our contribution we explain that, at a theoretical level, populism is prone to putting the welfare state under stress. Given that populist forces seek to (re)define who belongs to the political community, they challenge the existing interpretations about who should have social rights and who should pay for them. However, as we will argue in the second part of this contribution, populism practically never arises in its pure form, since it usually appears attached to other ideologies, which are crucial for developing political projects that are attractive to larger sections of the electorate. This is why, then, we focus on analysing two paradigmatic instances of populism in the contemporary world – inclusionary populism and exclusionary populism – in order to show the different approaches towards the welfare state that each of these subtypes of populism tend to support. Finally, we close our contribution by advancing some ideas about the future of the welfare state, which is under threat not only because of austerity and welfare retrenchment, but also due to the rise of populist forces of different kinds that seek to transform existing democratic institutions and procedures{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Despite their distinct behaviours in electoral politics, we have limited empirical knowledge about the characteristics that distinguish these three groups, given the typical underrepresentation of non-voters in surveys and the relative recency of large-scale research on populist voters. To address this gap, we analyse novel survey data from contemporary Germany that oversamples non-voters and includes a sizeable share of both populist radical left and populist radical right party supporters. Two main findings with broader implications stand out. First, populist voters resemble their mainstream counterparts in their expectations about democracy but correspond more closely to non-voters regarding (dis-)satisfaction with democracy. Second, non-voters and populist voters seem to reject mainstream democratic politics in distinct ways, throwing doubt on the (further) mobilization potential of abstainers for populist projects.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the structure and composition of the social network formed on the campus of the Faculty of Economics and Business of Diego Portales University, Chile, exposing a series of characteristics that are aligned with similar research in the field of networks. We use a model of social networks formation in order to understand socioeconomic and academic factors that predict the formation of friendship between two students. Specifically, we test empirically our model, using students' administrative information. Of special interest is the impact of the length of stay of the students in the university, with which we refer to the years completed in the degree course, in the probability of establishing friendship ties where being socioeconomically different is a condition. The mechanism behind a result like this is the sense of belongingness that being part of the same institution may induce amongst students. By means of counterfactual simulations we found evidence in favor that passing through the university increases the probability of forming friendship networks, which can mean a kind of social capital, thus reducing socioeconomic segregation from the Chilean school system. Given the importance of this finding, we believe that policies that increase the sense of belongingness such as cultural events, leaderships programs, and community should be implemented on university campuses.}

  abstract = {Resumen Desde un enfoque geográfico de la movilidad transfronteriza, este artículo se propone analizar las movilidades fronterizas de peruanos y bolivianos que habitan en las ciudades del norte chileno (Iquique y Antofagasta) y el acceso a la vivienda. Postulamos la tesis que estos sujetos migrantes se mueven en el espacio fronterizo fundamentalmente por razones laborales y por la diferencia ganancial que produce el cruce de las fronteras. Así, la cercanía con el lugar de origen, la posibilidad de ir, venir o quedarse, el ciclo de vida, así como las condiciones de precariedad laboral y de las viviendas a la que ellos y ellas acceden los convierten, en muchos casos, en sujetos móviles y multianclados. La movilidad se aprecia en la capacidad de moverse en la ciudad y el espacio fronterizo y el anclaje se observa a través del sentido que adquiere la vivienda y el acceso a ella. La investigación se sustenta en 16 entrevistas en profundidad realizadas en el marco de una investigación mayor, identificando así, los hitos más importantes en la movilidad y circularidad de los migrantes.},

We argue that this voter belief can yield advantages to hypothetical female candidates as voters sometimes punish them less for bribe accusations. We test these propositions with hypothetical vignettes of sub-national executive races in Uruguay, Argentina and Chile. We find that only Uruguayans prefer allegedly corrupt female over male candidates, but when Uruguayans are told that hypothetical corruption is widespread, they do not prefer accused females. Moreover, voters in none of the countries prefer females among candidates who have fought corruption. Our findings thereby demonstrate that voters’ preferences for corrupt female candidates in hypothetical races can vary not only according to the specific justifications for the wrongdoing, but also across countries.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that democracies are under threat around the world while the quest for strong leaders is increasing. Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (N = 5,741) demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies’ development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.},

  abstract = {Current urban neoliberalism processes have shaped and changed contemporary cities, including the local scale’s built environment and social relations. This article aims to study how such transformations affect local sociability by analyzing the effects of neighborhoods’ morphology and socio-demographic characteristics on different forms of interactions and how they affect the sense of belonging. Taking the Metropolitan Area of Santiago, Chile, as a case study, we gathered secondary data on urban morphology and surveyed ten neighborhoods to measure sociability patterns. The results obtained from multilevel logistic regression models show that time living in the neighborhood and public pedestrian space is the most critical factor affecting neighborhood sociability. Moreover, instead of local ties, public familiarity is the form of sociability with the most substantial effects on a sense of belonging. We conclude that recent neighborhoods, formed by neoliberal urbanization, tend to discourage neighborhood sociability and a sense of belonging.},

El epicentro de la crisis fue la especulación con créditos de vivienda orientados a hogares insolventes y riesgosos, y la creación de títulos securitizados a partir de esas deudas. El concepto de “financiarización” se posicionó como tópico frecuente en los estudios urbano-regionales y en centros de investigación en finanzas. El creciente uso que se le ha dado a este concepto ha provocado cierto eclectisimo en el significado, siendo empleado indistintamente para adscribir a una tesis económica que explica descensos en la formación bruta de capital fijo y PIB en la economía, o simplemente para describir un ámbito emergente de interacción entre finanzas y – en este caso – el sector de bienes raíces. El presente dossier aborda la financiarización inmobiliaria acogiendo un abanico bastante amplio de enfoques sobre el tema. Por este motivo, se considera necesario proponer una definición genérica que vertebre los trabajos aquí expuestos. Por varias razones, conviene adoptar una perspectiva de economía política institucional, es decir vinculada al estudio de agentes e instituciones. Buscamos hablar no sólo de finanzas sino también acerca de geografía, espacios y agentes.},

  abstract = {Many authors agree that gentrification in Latin America depends on the intervention of the state. However, for the renovation of large urban areas that have long lacked public attention, state intervention is a pivotal driver. This comparative analysis involved fieldwork analysis and short ethnographies in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. Results show variations and some common threads, namely land valorization policies, schemes designed to promote the creation of economic opportunities for upper-income investors and developers, the establishment of creative or cultural industrial hubs, investment in new transport and cultural infrastructure, city rebranding, and the use of iconic architecture. Displacement policies have been implemented in Brazil, although with limited success. In Brazil and Mexico, attempts have been made to control social behaviors within particular spaces, often in a racialized manner. We arrive at a narrative that differs from that of the Global North, which considers state-led gentrification to constitute the privatization of social housing under the hegemonic imposition of discourses of “social mixing.” The concept of state and its trajectory differ considerably in each hemisphere.}

This is because it does not refer to the direct experience of crime, but to a multiplicity of factors that develop on the scale of the street, the neighborhood and the city. Literature has shown that behind the fear of crime are hidden various fears and concerns experienced by the subjects. An aspect less explored by urban studies and criminology refers to how this feeling, which is subjectively determined in daily life, is interwoven in processes and transformations of the city scale. From a qualitative study carried out in the commune of Maipú in Santiago, Chile, this article explores the judgments and evaluations that the subjects perceive and mean the danger and the crime and how these are related to the urban changes in their neighboring environments. The results show that, in a territory affected by urban transformations, the figure of the “empeligrosamiento” towards the unknown emerges, constitutes a form of relation that signifies social interactions at the same time as it sharpens the loss of subjective control over the neighborhood space in which it is inhabited.},

Overtourism affects picturesque places, and these areas end up losing their authenticity, submitting themselves to the consumption needs of tourists. Neighborhoods’ traditional residents also see their routine completely changed due to the different habits of tourists, and displacement rates rise. This study aims to understand how local people perceive tourism in Alfama, one of the most unique and tourist-oriented neighborhoods of Lisbon. Our study involves a questionnaire to old long-term residents and content analysis of their responses. We used Leximancer software to create categories of analysis depending on frequency of mentions and the way themes are related. Our interviewees testified that overtourism in Alfama generates perceptions that range from a generalized acceptance for the benefits that an improved safety associated to an increased street-life and a cleaner neighborhood generate, and on the other hand the grievance for the loss of a pre-existing community. We also conclude that the benefits of tourist-led gentrification are relevant for the gentrification analysis because they show the contradictions that the remaining residential community experience as tourist-led gentrification unfolds.},

Mientras el primer fenómeno era absolutamente inesperado e implicó un giro importante en la agenda política del país, el segundo era bastante probable que terminara en un triunfo de la opción a favor del cambio constitucional, pero la contundencia del resultado fue sorpresiva. En este artículo analizamos ambos hitos en detalle. Por un lado, examinamos cómo el gobierno en particular, y el sistema político en general, reaccionaron frente a la irrupción y el desarrollo de la pandemia. Por otro lado, basándonos en una encuesta cara a cara representativa de la población – que se llevó a cabo justo después del plebiscito – mostramos empíricamente que el voto “Rechazo” se explica en gran medida por las variables que en estudios comparados se utilizan para predecir apoyo a fuerzas de derecha populista radical, mientras que el voto “Apruebo” se caracteriza por una alta heterogeneidad en términos ideológicos y sociológicos. En resumen, la evidencia aquí presentada refuerza los hallazgos de otras investigaciones que muestran un aumento de las tensiones al interior del bloque de centroderecha y, a su vez, permite pensar que en Chile están dadas las condiciones para que se establezca una fuerza de derecha populista radical.Palabras Clave:~derecha; populismo; plebiscito; proceso constituyente; Covid-19}

  abstract = {Democracy is under threat today and scholars agree that the main challenge is not sudden regime breakdown, but rather the gradual erosion of key institutions and norms because of growing public support to political forces with illiberal tendencies. In the case of Western Europe, the major threat comes from the populist radical right. Although it is true that the latter has been gaining votes in Western Europe, scholars have not analysed the extent to which a sizeable share of the electorate dislikes this party family. Nevertheless, recent studies reveal that it is important to consider both those who feel close to and those who reject political parties, i.e. positive and negative partisanship. To address this research gap, in this contribution we rely on original survey data for 10 Western European countries to examine negative partisanship towards the populist radical right. The empirical analysis reveals that a large section of the Western European electorate has an aversion to this party family and this finding should be seen as an important sign of democratic resilience. In fact, those who dislike the populist radical right are strong supporters of both democracy per se and the liberal democratic regime.},

In order to test our hypothesis, we use survey data from Chile (Casen) for the years 2011 and 2013. We use the Duncan Index to measure segregation based on income at the municipality level for 324 municipalities. LS is obtained from the CASEN survey, which considers a question about self-reported well-being. Segregation’s impact upon LS is not clear at first glance. On one hand, there is evidence telling that segregation’s consequences are negative due to the spatial concentration of poverty and all the woes related to it. On the other hand, segregation would have positive effects because people may feel stress, unhappiness, and alienation when comparing themselves to better-off households. Additionally, there is previous evidence regarding the fact that people prefer to neighbor people of a similar socioeconomic background. Hence, an empirical test is needed. In order to implement it, we should deal with two problems, first, the survey limited statistical significance at the municipal level, hence we use the small area estimation (SAE) methodology to improve the estimations’ statistic properties, and second, the double causality between segregation and LS; to deal with the latter, we include lagged LS as a regressor. Our findings indicate that socioeconomic segregation has a positive effect on LS. This result is robust to different econometric specifications.}

  abstract = {Concern around personal safety is a significant factor in constraining women’s access to and use of public space. One strategy presented to address this involves altering the design of built environments. However, tension and controversy surround these arguments in the literature on safety perception in public space. This study seeks to explore whether the presence of three design interventions commonly cited in the literature act to enhance or reduce perceptions of safety in public space, focusing on women’s experiences in particular. Three design interventions are examined: public toilets, solid walls, and graffiti removal. To test these interventions, an image-based randomised control trial with 104 participants was conducted in 2018 in London (UK). A series of control and treatment images simulating each design intervention was viewed and ranked by participants according to perceived safety. The findings of this study suggest that: the presence of public toilets does not affect perceived safety; eliminating graffiti has a weak significant impact on perceived safety; and removing solid walls leads to significant improvements of perceptions of safety, with the effect being stronger for women. These results suggest that to maximise investment effectiveness, urban design and planning policies that aim to increase perceptions of safety should be evidence-based, and need to integrate a gendered perspective. The presented technique could support urban design processes by examining the safety-enhancement impact of proposed public space interventions prior to their being rolled out.},

We analyse the extent to which upper-, middle-, and lower class individuals congregate in social networks with similar others, while following Bourdieu and expecting that in particular the networks of the higher social strata are segregated in terms of social capital. We test our argument with large-scale, representative survey data for the Chilean urban population aged 18–75 years (n = 2,517) and build an integrated indicator of people’s social class that combines measures of education, occupational class, and household income. Our regression analyses show that upper-class individuals have larger networks and access to more varied and prestigious social resources than their middle- and lower class counterparts. Interestingly, however, we found a U-shaped relationship between social class and class homogeneity, indicating that network segregation is high at the top as well as at the bottom of the class-based social strata. In contrast, the classes in the middle have more heterogeneous class networks, possibly forming an important bridge between the “edges” of the class structure. These findings demonstrate that whereas social and economic capital cumulates in higher classes, the lower classes are socially deprived next to their economic disadvantage.}

We hypothesize that residents of different areas, especially those living in spatial contexts of poverty and wealth, differ considerably in terms of the social resources to which they have access. We combine survey data with georeferenced data from 700 residents in 181 census tracts. The spatial structure is measured as a combination of spatial conditions, such as land values, density, and urban violence. Our results show that the spatial structure determines network resources, even after considering social class. Specifically, living in privileged areas is associated with highly resourceful networks, whereas living in marginalized areas goes together with network poverty and low-status contacts. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial segregation reinforces differential social resources among classes.},

Conceptually, we complement the literature on ‘neighbourhood effects’, which typically addresses the influence of concentrated disadvantage, by focusing on concentrated advantage and its influence on educational outcomes. We construct a panel with all school students who took a national standardized mathematics test in 2010, 2014 and 2016 in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. We complement it with survey data for the 52 districts of the Metropolitan Region, clustering the districts based on factors such as unemployment, economic inequality, access to services, experiences of violence and stigmatization. Our different identification strategies consistently show that concentrated poverty and affluence are both relevant for explaining educational achievement in mathematics above and beyond individual and school characteristics.},

  abstract = {This study examines how perceptions of residential reputation and stigma vary according to differences in social class and spatial structures. The focus of our inquiry is the city of Santiago, Chile – a highly segregated city in Latin America. We suggest that residential stigma is the focus of a larger assemblage of material and non-material marginalization; it is a point of convergence of multiple forms of social stratification. We combine a representative survey of 600 residents with geo-referenced census data, building composite measures to represent concrete class and spatial structures using clustering techniques. Results reveal that living in more affluent segregated areas is associated with a better perceived residential reputation, whereas perceived residential stigma is greater in geographical areas with a high concentration of poverty, land devaluation, population density, and overcrowding, regardless of whether these areas present high levels of criminality. Interestingly, when we include social class along with the spatial structure, the former loses significance as a predictor of both perceived residential reputation and stigma. The spatial structure therefore goes some way toward mediating the relationship between class and perceived residential reputation. This suggests the need for public policies designed to reduce the current symbolic domination that exists in Santiago.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Introduction: Activists mobilize using various protest strategies to advance their demands but few studies analyze protest events to explain their choice of peaceful, disruptive, and violent methods. This paper argues that when movements have few supporters and allies - major resources for mobilization - they privilege violent tactics. Conversely, when mobilizations have more participants and partners, protests are more likely to use peaceful or disruptive strategies. Materials and methods: The paper uses a mixed methods research design. From a quantitative perspective, it uses a dataset of 4,700 college student protests in Latin America to test the theoretical claims with logistic regressions. A case study of protest tactics and resources during the December 2014-January 2015 youth protests in Lima, Peru is used to illustrate how human resources shape the repertoire of contention. This qualitative section uses evidence from interviews as well as secondary data. Results: The results of the regression analyses partially support the theory, showing that more participants tend to make protests more peaceful and disruptive and less violent. The effect of certain allies, however, goes against theoretical expectations. As the case study shows, after a relatively violent first march, young activists in Lima organized themselves on a territorial basis, which both decreased the influence of political parties in the movement and increased the number of activists and actors involved, making subsequent demonstrations less violent. However, the case study also shows that the presence of specific political actors is inherently associated with more violent strategies. Discussion: This paper shows how the presence of allies and the number of demonstrators, as major resources available to social movements, shape the choice of tactics used in protest events. While more participants and the presence of allies makes events more contained, the evidence also suggests that both very large numbers of participants and the addition of disparate actors into a mobilization may promote violence.},

We maintain that, although it can promote participatory attitudes, the way it is implemented shapes its effects.

La autoconstrucción ha posibilitado la irrupción de nuevas formas de ciudadanía en las cuales los pobres han generado nuevos espacios de participación cívica que los han convertido en legítimos portadores de derechos. ¿Qué ocurre, sin embargo, cuando los agentes de la autoconstrucción son inmigrantes demandando no solo el derecho a la vivienda, sino también su reconocimiento como sujetos de derechos en un Estado-nación que no los considera ciudadanos? Este artículo discute dicha pregunta examinando etnográficamente el caso del campamento Nueva Esperanza, asentamiento autoconstruido por inmigrantes de origen latinoamericano en la comuna de Colina, Santiago. Concluimos que, para constituirse como ciudadanos, los extranjeros formulan un tipo “urbano” de ciudadanía, en donde el acto de residir en la ciudad los convierte en legítimos portadores de derechos. En dicho proceso, estos residentes construyen narrativas éticas y políticas a través de las cuales significan sus deseos de incorporación y pertenencia a la comunidad política nacional.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a revival of social protest and labor union activity in Chile. In this article, we examine the effects of this phenomenon to analyze its influence on working-class identity. Using International Social Survey Programme surveys from 2009 and 2019, we investigate whether class location and union membership affect people’s subjective identification with the working class and how that effect may have changed over the decade. Our findings suggest that subjects who are situated in a ‘subordinated’ class position (unskilled workers or informal self-employed workers) are more likely to identify with the working class compared to subjects located in a privileged class position (employers, experts, or managers). However, surprisingly, our analysis does not indicate that working-class identity is reinforced by union membership. In addition, our results do not demonstrate that the effect of class or union membership has strengthened over the past decade. At the end of this article, we offer some possible explanations for these findings.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, academic debates around neoliberalism in Latin America have shifted from evaluations of the drawbacks and virtues of the application of neoliberal policies for achieving socioeconomic development, towards discussions imagining and implementing alternatives. After thirty years of neoliberal reform, even neoliberal advocates have increasingly recognised the pernicious effects that the process of neoliberalization have had on people's lives. The fleeting left and centre-left moment brought renewed hopes and expectations of a post-neoliberal future. However, post-neoliberal states could not solve the contradictions of neoliberalism and told us much about its resilience and adaptability. This article offers an overview of the dynamics of neoliberalism's resilience and contestation in Latin America as treated by extant literature as a way to account for the politics of neoliberalism in the region, its rise and its current status.},

  abstract = {Although it is true that populism is a contested concept in the social sciences, there is increasing consensus around the use of an ideational definition of populism within the political science literature. This definition has the advantage of providing a clear concept that can be employed to empirically study not only the supply side but also the demand side of the populist phenomenon. Not by chance, an increasing number of scholars are working with a set of survey items to measure the presence and relevance of populist ideas at the mass level, something that is usually conceived of as populist attitudes. Despite the incremental study of populist attitudes in political science, only very limited links with the political psychology literature have been established so far. In this short piece, I address this shortcoming by discussing two avenues for further research on populism that seek to promote much-needed dialogue between comparative politics and political psychology: political identities and conspiracy theories.

  abstract = {Although ethnic differentiations began with colonialism, racism was not widely addressed in Latin American social sciences until recently, since class perspectives were predominant. Within this, studies on residential segregation and urban exclusion have ignored race and ethnicity, with the exceptions of Brazil and Colombia. However, these issues have recently become crucial because of the adoption of multiculturalism, the impact of postcolonialism and postmodernism, the emergence of black and indigenous social movements, changes in state policy, and new trends in migration. A review of debates and evidence from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina shows that persistent colonial ideologies, narratives, and popular perceptions of ethno-racial denial sustain various kinds of urban exclusion in the region. The evidence calls for a new research agenda to decolonize urban studies that adopts a critical perspective on the coloniality of power., Aunque las diferenciaciones étnicas comenzaron con el colonialismo, el racismo no se abordó ampliamente en las ciencias sociales latinoamericanas hasta hace poco, ya que predominaban las perspectivas de clase. Los estudios sobre la segregación residencial y la exclusión urbana han ignorado la raza y el origen étnico, con excepción de Brasil y Colombia. Sin embargo, estas cuestiones se han vuelto cruciales recientemente debido a la adopción del multiculturalismo, el impacto del poscolonialismo y el posmodernismo, la aparición de movimientos sociales negros e indígenas, los cambios en la política estatal y nuevas tendencias en la migración. Una revisión de los debates y evidencia en México, Colombia, Chile y Argentina muestra que las ideologías coloniales persistentes, las narrativas y las percepciones populares de la negación etnoracial sostienen varios tipos de exclusión urbana en la región.

Denying workers’ dignity constitutes a direct threat towards their well-being. The aim of this paper is to adapt and validate the Spanish version of the Workplace Dignity Scale (WDS). Method: An instrumental design was executed in order to adapt the scale to Spanish with a Mexican population (N = 588). Following back-translation, three studies were conducted in which confirmatory factor analysis, correlations, regressions, and invariance analysis were applied. Results: The results showed that the Spanish adaptation conforms to the six-factor structure of the original scale and that organisational dehumanisation and workers’ self-objectification predicted dignity at work; with workers’ self-objectification being the variable that most strongly predicted workers’ dignity. Finally, we also evaluated measurement invariance comparing our data with the results of the original scale. In general, results indicated that even when the Spanish version of the WDS presented an adequate factor structure, its measurement presented different factor loadings and slopes compared with the measurement of the original scale. Conclusions: In general, we have an instrument adapted to the Mexican context that allows us to evaluate workers’ sense of dignity in the workplace.},

The interactions between disruptive and affective power forced political elites to enter in a constitutional process now underway that may reorder power cages in the decades to come.},

  abstract = {Using social exchange theory, this article presents a new theory for understanding the strategic choices made by social movement leaders—the “movement exchanges” theory. It looks at how leaders engage in exchanges of valued rewards with constituencies, institutional political players, bystander publics, and voluntary organizations. Leaders receive from these players important rewards (like committed activists, political leverage, and resources) for achieving movement goals. In turn, leaders make strategic choices (expressed in frames, tactics, targets, and claims) that other players find rewarding, favoring persistent exchanges across time. By considering movements’ simultaneous exchanges with several players, the theory makes sense of choices that remain puzzling for major movement theories. It also blends strategic behavior with culture (in the form of utopias, ideology, and emotions) but does not require the maximizing assumption of the homo economicus. I use the case of the contemporary Chilean student movement to illustrate the theory.},

The study reveals the importance that copper has on the development of the Chilean economy. It arises in the relationship changes in the supply and demand of inputs made by this activity. Additionally, the results show a weakening in the sensitivities regarding the relations of the manufacturing industry. This effect is known in the input-output literature as “hollowing-out”. A decay of the complexity of the industry’s linkages implies a reduction in the sensitivity of direct, indirect, and total links with the rest of the productive system. It also means increasing dependence on the rest of the world on input providers.},

Para ello, revisamos los antecedentes históricos, las características centrales y las dinámicas comerciales de cada una de ellas. Para comprender la vinculación entre ambas ZF proponemos un modelo de integración que se articula a partir de las dinámicas de comercialización en dos escalas: “por arriba” (inversión de capital, acuerdos comerciales internacionales, políticas estatales y contrabando a gran escala) y “por abajo” (comercio, distribución y contrabando a micro-escala). A diferencia de “desde arriba” y “desde abajo”, los postulados más clásicos del “transnacionalismo” que tienden a asumir que se trata de dos niveles que funcionan de manera independiente, en este estudio mostramos que ambos niveles son completamente interdependientes y que esto es resultado de la imbricación de prácticas legales e ilegales, así como de prácticas formales e informales que se producen en el circuito de comercialización entre ambas ZF. Nuestro abordaje metodológico se sostiene en entrevistas focalizadas, registros etnográficos y revisión de literatura especializada, de documentos institucionales y de prensa.},

En una primera lectura ambos enfoques pueden parecer opuestos, pero lo cierto es que se vienen aplicando simultáneamente, aunque con variaciones de intensidad de acuerdo a los distintos contextos políticos. A partir de trabajos previos realizados por las investigadoras analizaremos cómo ambos enfoques han impactado a la población venezolana en el país.

  abstract = {Do leaders who build a sense of shared social identity in their teams thereby protect them from the adverse effects of workplace stress? This is a question that the present paper explores by testing the hypothesis that identity leadership contributes to stronger team identification among employees and, through this, is associated with reduced burnout. We tested this model with unique datasets from the Global Identity Leadership Development (GILD) project with participants from all inhabited continents. We compared two datasets from 2016/2017 (n = 5290; 20 countries) and 2020/2021 (n = 7294; 28 countries) and found very similar levels of identity leadership, team identification and burnout across the five years. An inspection of the 2020/2021 data at the onset of and later in the COVID-19 pandemic showed stable identity leadership levels and slightly higher levels of both burnout and team identification. Supporting our hypotheses, we found almost identical indirect effects (2016/2017, b = −0.132; 2020/2021, b = −0.133) across the five-year span in both datasets. Using a subset of n = 111 German participants surveyed over two waves, we found the indirect effect confirmed over time with identity leadership (at T1) predicting team identification and, in turn, burnout, three months later. Finally, we explored whether there could be a “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect for identity leadership. Speaking against this, we found a u-shaped quadratic effect whereby ratings of identity leadership at the upper end of the distribution were related to even stronger team identification and a stronger indirect effect on reduced burnout.},

  abstract = {Humans are social animals, but not everyone will be mindful of others to the same extent. Individual differences have been found, but would social mindfulness also be shaped by one’s location in the world? Expecting cross-national differences to exist, we examined if and how social mindfulness differs across countries. At little to no material cost, social mindfulness typically entails small acts of attention or kindness. Even though fairly common, such low-cost cooperation has received little empirical attention. Measuring social mindfulness across 31 samples from industrialized countries and regions (               n               = 8,354), we found considerable variation. Among selected country-level variables, greater social mindfulness was most strongly associated with countries’ better general performance on environmental protection. Together, our findings contribute to the literature on prosociality by targeting the kind of everyday cooperation that is more focused on communicating benevolence than on providing material benefits.},

  abstract = {Current South American populations trace their origins mainly to three continental ancestries, i.e. European, Amerindian and African. Individual variation in relative proportions of each of these ancestries may be confounded with socio-economic factors due to population stratification. Therefore, ancestry is a potential confounder variable that should be considered in epidemiologic studies and in public health plans. However, there are few studies that have assessed the ancestry of the current admixed Chilean population. This is partly due to the high cost of genome-scale technologies commonly used to estimate ancestry. In this study we have designed a small panel of SNPs to accurately assess ancestry in the largest sampling to date of the Chilean mestizo population (n\,=\,3349) from eight cities. Our panel is also able to distinguish between the two main Amerindian components of Chileans: Aymara from the north and Mapuche from the south.},

  abstract = {A wide range of literature connects sex ratio and mating behaviours in non-human animals. However, research examining sex ratio and human mating is limited in scope. Prior work has examined the relationship between sex ratio and desire for short-term, uncommitted mating as well as outcomes such as marriage and divorce rates. Less empirical attention has been directed towards the relationship between sex ratio and mate preferences, despite the importance of mate preferences in the human mating literature. To address this gap, we examined sex ratio's relationship to the variation in preferences for attractiveness, resources, kindness, intelligence and health in a long-term mate across 45 countries (               n               = 14 487). We predicted that mate preferences would vary according to relative power of choice on the mating market, with increased power derived from having relatively few competitors and numerous potential mates. We found that each sex tended to report more demanding preferences for attractiveness and resources where the opposite sex was abundant, compared to where the opposite sex was scarce. This pattern dovetails with those found for mating strategies in humans and mate preferences across species, highlighting the importance of sex ratio for understanding variation in human mate preferences.},
